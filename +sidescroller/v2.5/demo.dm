//   This demo shows how to use the features that are new
//   in version 2.5 of the library. These features include:
//
//    * debugging trace
//
//   This demo also shows how to create variable-height jumps,
//   the longer you hold the jump key the higher you'll do.
//   This doesn't use a new feature, it's just a new example
//   of existing features.
