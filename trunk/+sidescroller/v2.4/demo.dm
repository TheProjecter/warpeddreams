//   This demo shows how to use the features that are new
//   in version 2.4 of the library. These features include:
//
//    * camera modes (slide and follow)
//    * camera lag
//    * camera bounds (minx, maxx, miny, maxy)
//    * stepped_on, stepped_off, and stepping_on procs

// We define three areas to create "rooms" by setting
// the minx, maxx, miny, and maxy of the mob's camera
// when the mob enters the area. By setting minx and
// maxx to the same value we can create areas where the
// camera only scrolls vertically. We can create the
// same effect for horizontal scrolling only by setting
// miny equal to maxy.

	// Idea:
	// It'd be neat to define an object (ex: /obj/camera) and place
	// them inside these areas. Then, in the area's constructor, use
	// these objects to determine the values for minx, maxx, etc. For
	// example, minx would be set to 32 times the x coordinate of the
	// leftmost camera object in the area. This would let you define
	// the bounds of the camera entirely in the map editor and you
	// wouldn't need to do any work to calculate coordinates (or to
	// re-calculate coordinates when the map changes).
